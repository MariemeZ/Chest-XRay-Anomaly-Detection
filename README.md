# Chest-XRay-Anomaly-Detection

This repository contains code and resources for detecting anomalies in pneumonia using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a model that can detect anomalies in pneumonia cases from medical images. The notebook includes detailed steps for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes medical images labeled for pneumonia. Details about the dataset and its source are provided in the notebook.

## Results
The results of the anomaly detection model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and visualizations, are detailed in the notebook. Example images with detected anomalies are also included.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
